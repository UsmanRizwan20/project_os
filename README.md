Task Scheduler Simulator – Operating Systems Project
Built a CPU scheduling simulator in C++ on Linux that models classical OS scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF (non-preemptive), Round Robin, and SRTF.
The system visualizes execution using Gantt charts and calculates waiting time and turnaround time to compare scheduling efficiency.
